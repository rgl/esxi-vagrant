#
# at installation time ESXi remembers the MAC addresses and will always
# use those even when we switch them at the qemu/VM level, so in order
# to be able to launch this with vagrant, we need to reset them.
#
# the MAC addresses are stored inside /etc/vmware/esx.conf, e.g.:
#
#   /net/vmkernelnic/child[0000]/mac = "52:54:00:12:34:56"
#   /net/pnic/child[0000]/mac = "52:54:00:12:34:56"
#   /net/pnic/child[0000]/virtualMac = "00:50:56:5d:29:50"
#
